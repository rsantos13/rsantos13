<br/>

Passionate about technology and innovation, I am an Android software engineer with extensive experience in app development. I have a solid background working in startups, where I learned to be agile and adaptable, handling all phases of the software development lifecycle. Additionally, I dedicate my free time to personal projects, creating innovative solutions and exploring new tools and technologies.

With strong expertise in Java, Kotlin, Flutter, and Swift, and proficiency in Android Studio and Jetpack, I am always seeking new challenges that allow me to grow professionally and contribute to impactful technological solutions. My knowledge of Flutter and Swift enables me to develop high-quality cross-platform applications, meeting the needs of both Android and iOS users.
